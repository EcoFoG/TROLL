This page summaries the study of sylviculture on forest ecosystem with TROLL model. 

# Introduction

To study resistance and resilience of ecosystem face to disturbance, highlighting the role of biodiversity, we decided to use TROLL model simulations [@Chave1999]. 

# Sensitivity

In order to get a finer study of simulations response, we needed to assess first sensitivity of the TROLL model to different parameters. More particularly we needed to assess the importance of functional traits to further better control functional diversities in simulations. We also needed to assess sensitivity of the model to see rain constant because we assume it is one of the main factor of tree recruitments after disturbance in the model.

Results are available on [sensitivity](sensitivity.html) page.

We concluded that we will control biodiversity in input with a 3-dimensionnal functional space including ah, wsg and dmax. And we can let seedrain constant to its default value without any risk of untaken side effect.

# Disturbance

We then started to realize the disturbance experiments:

Results are available on [disturbance](disturbance.html) page.

But we found simulations issues with low LMA species :

Results are available on [low LMA species](LMAmin.html) page.

The issue seemed link to leaf lifespan allometry. We searched for a new allometry :

Results are available on leaf lifespan [first](LL2.html) and [second](LL.html) model pages.

Data origins are summarized in [data table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WI7F2s-tnGG8r983lBEgnCiuvX61-g0y0xY7H_dr7dg/edit?usp=sharing).

# Sylviculture

We first needed to implement a realistic module to simulate sylviculture inside TROLL :

Description of sylviculture module is made on [sylviculture](sylviculture.html) page.

In order to realize the sylviculture module we established different models linking probability for a tree to be probbed as rotten and final volume of wood to its diameter at breast height.

Results are summarized on [rotten](rotten.html), [rotten2](rotten2.html) and [rotten3](rotten3.html) pages.

In order to realize the sylviculture module we established a model for increased mortality around gaps.

Results are summarized on [hurt](hurt.html) page.
